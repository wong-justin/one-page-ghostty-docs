beware, lots of ugliness: some hard-coding, lots of copy-paste from ghostty docs, some unneccesary artifacts from prototyping, some typos

using project structure of `npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight`

the main page is at content/docs/index.mdx

the rest of the code is in src/components

mdx is such a messy format. next time, i will try not to mix markdown with js, custom components, and html.

also src/custom.css to override some starlight styles and write my own. for now, i prefer a global css file over local component styles. sometimes i used !important to override hard-to-beat local-scoped styles. sorry.

i modified a few starlight components like tabs, header. couldn't get footer, head working tho. copy-pasting the original implementations didn't work because imports in starlight source code are different than imports in my source code.

plugins/wahtever.js is a just build script, playing by astro/starlight/expressive-code rules. it checks the lines in a regular expressive-code block and searches for ghostty keywords, then highlights/links them to their respective h3s/descriptions. i think it's kinda clever.

including pagefind was one step with starlight. very nice. not sure about configuring pagefind, tho.

images should probably go in src/assets, once i get around to adding screenshots. i think astro compresses/optimizes the images automatically?
and static assets like favicons apparently go in public/. :shrug:
