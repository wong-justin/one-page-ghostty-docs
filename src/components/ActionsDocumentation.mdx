### [crash](#crash)
Crash ghostty in the desired thread for the focused surface.

WARNING: This is a hard crash (panic) and data can be lost.

The purpose of this action is to test crash handling. For some
users, it may be useful to test crash reporting functionality in
order to determine if it all works as expected.

The value determines the crash location:

  - "main" - crash on the main (GUI) thread.
  - "io" - crash on the IO thread for the focused surface.
  - "render" - crash on the render thread for the focused surface.

---

---

### [quit](#quit)

---

### [reload_config](#reload_config)

in use but this usually involves re-reading the configuration file
and applying any changes. Note that not all changes can be applied at
runtime.

---

### [reset](#reset)
Reset the terminal. This can fix a lot of issues when a running
program puts the terminal into a broken state. This is equivalent to
when you type "reset" and press enter.

If you do this while in a TUI program such as vim, this may break
the program. If you do this while in a shell, you may have to press
enter after to get a new prompt.

---

---

---

### [toggle_fullscreen](#toggle_fullscreen)
Toggle fullscreen mode of window.

---

### [toggle_maximize](#toggle_maximize)
Toggle maximized window state. This only works on Linux.

---

### [toggle_quick_terminal](#toggle_quick_terminal)
Toggle the "quick" terminal. The quick terminal is a terminal that
appears on demand from a keybinding, often sliding in from a screen
edge such as the top. This is useful for quick access to a terminal
without having to open a new window or tab.

When the quick terminal loses focus, it disappears. The terminal state
is preserved between appearances, so you can always press the keybinding
to bring it back up.

To enable the quick terminal globally so that Ghostty doesn't
have to be focused, prefix your keybind with `global`. Example:

```ini
keybind = global:cmd+grave_accent=toggle_quick_terminal
```

The quick terminal has some limitations:

  - It is a singleton; only one instance can exist at a time.
  - It does not support tabs, but it does support splits.
  - It will not be restored when the application is restarted
    (for systems that support window restoration).
  - It supports fullscreen, but fullscreen will always be a non-native
    fullscreen (macos-non-native-fullscreen = true). This only applies
    to the quick terminal window. This is a requirement due to how
    the quick terminal is rendered.

See the various configurations for the quick terminal in the
configuration file to customize its behavior.

This currently only works on macOS.

---

### [toggle_secure_input](#toggle_secure_input)
Toggle secure input mode on or off. This is used to prevent apps
that monitor input from seeing what you type. This is useful for
entering passwords or other sensitive information.

This applies to the entire application, not just the focused
terminal. You must toggle it off to disable it, or quit Ghostty.

This only works on macOS, since this is a system API on macOS.

---

### [toggle_split_zoom](#toggle_split_zoom)
zoom/unzoom the current split.

---

### [toggle_tab_overview](#toggle_tab_overview)
Toggle the tab overview.
This only works with libadwaita enabled currently.

---

### [toggle_visibility](#toggle_visibility)
Show/hide all windows. If all windows become shown, we also ensure
Ghostty becomes focused. When hiding all windows, focus is yielded
to the next application as determined by the OS.

Note: When the focused surface is fullscreen, this method does nothing.

This currently only works on macOS.

---

### [toggle_window_decorations](#toggle_window_decorations)
Toggle window decorations on and off. This only works on Linux.

---

### [unbind](#unbind)
This action is used to flag that the binding should be removed from
the set. This should never exist in an active set and `set.put` has an
assertion to verify this.

---

### [write_screen_file](#write_screen_file)
Same as write_scrollback_file but writes the full screen contents.
See write_scrollback_file for available values.

---

### [write_scrollback_file](#write_scrollback_file)
Write the entire scrollback into a temporary file. The action
determines what to do with the filepath. Valid values are:

  - "paste": Paste the file path into the terminal.
  - "open": Open the file in the default OS editor for text files.
    The default OS editor is determined by using `open` on macOS
    and `xdg-open` on Linux.

---

### [write_selection_file](#write_selection_file)
Same as write_scrollback_file but writes the selected text.
If there is no selected text this does nothing (it doesn't
even create an empty file). See write_scrollback_file for
available values.
