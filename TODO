CURRENTLY COOKING UP:

BACK BURNER:

- add filters separating X11 and Wayland paremeters/sentences, like
GTK/Linux + X11   GTK/Linux + Wayland   macOS

- <meta description>

- write my own / edit existing overview for configuration, and overview for keybinds too
    - then link "keybind" keyword to h2 Keybinds and Actions, removing the normal small description maybe?

- get table of contents (TOC) working again

- ux: when clicking on keyword, use js to smart scroll the definition/h3 directly next to the clicked keyword, instead of jumping to top and using browser anchor links
    - consider sticky header as a potential solution to preserve horizontal alignment / prevent jumping to anchors

- auto detect macos/appley user agent, or linux

- link keywords when mentioned in other parts of the docs
    - automate this so it recognizes when it happens again in newly added content

- ux: increase link color contrast, at least for dark mode

- ux: choose a font / style that makes code href visually distinct from plaintext code on all platforms (color change? add chain link icon? underline again? custom font?)

- add content for about, installation?, color themes... probably lrequires collapsible sections, i think. and TOC.

- add pagefind highlight results

- adjust pagefind search weights and settings; because currently, searching for "quit" doesn't yield the h3 for quit in the top few results. h3s should probably be weighted heavier, and maybe increase the max results shown by a few too

- generate opengraph images? thats like a CI/CD astro integration honestly, so wait until i publish the repo and mess with github actions and automate the more-important build steps

- nit: put noscripts where they belong, like on pagefind searchbar, and the tabs, and the color theme switcher too

- edit words with my own writing, trying to simplify / standardize / practice. also there are some simple formatting errors and inconsistencies.

- linting, like with vale

- add entry to projects section of my website

- add visual indicator when a keyword is clicked/hovered that highlgihts or emphasizes the corresponding keyword link. or perhaps just a backlink from the h3.

- put scrollable ldetails panes in cards, even with sadows at top/bottom, to better visually demarcate the content areas. mainly for wider screens.

- ghostty.not.in-one.page redirects to ghostty.org?

OTHER THOUGHTS:

- emphasize the one-page-ness, as opposed to multi-page-ness of ghostty.org. how that relates to searching, clicking, looking,   thinking. eg. "linux users don't have to read abuot macos features". how filtering by platform means wading thru X% less content. compare a reader's usecase between both doc versions, eg. "wondering why $TERM has xterm", or "how do i reload my config", or "what are all the ways i can customize my keybinds"

- pending documentation improvements that have been suggested i think on ghostty github discussions, but not much progress that i can see:
    - showing default values;
    - thoroughly document keybind action parameters (im thinking docopt style, like (opt|opt2) <int>);
        - also thoroghly document config option values too, like (true|false|clipboard)
    - differentiating between cli plus-commands and keybinds actions, since they're both just called "actions";
    - add link to h3s and also copytoclpboard button for h3s
    - add at least one screenshot, or perhaps a gallery
